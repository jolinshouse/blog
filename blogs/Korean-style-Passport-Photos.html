            <p class="mt-4">Today, I went to HOLO+FACE at the Yulon City store in Xindian to get passport and U.S. visa photos taken. I had booked my appointment online beforehand, which made the entire process smooth and efficient.</p>
          <div class="mt-4">
            <img src="../images/make-up prepare.jpeg" class="d-block w-100 object-fit-cover rounded-4" style="height: 504px;" alt="My friends">
          </div>
          <h2 class="mt-4"><b>Services and Pricing</b></h2>
          <div class="mt-4">
            <p><b>1. Passport Photos</b> - NT$100</p>
            <p><b>2. Additional Photo Prints</b> - â‚©30,000 (2 hours 30 minutes)</p>
          </div>


          <p class="mt-4">Upon arrival, I was pleased to find a variety of white shirts and suit jackets available for borrowing. This was incredibly convenient as it ensured I had the perfect attire for my photos. Facing a mirror during the shoot allowed me to check my appearance and make any last-minute adjustments. The photographer was exceptionally professional and attentive, even helping me fix my hair to ensure it looked just right. Their dedication and expertise made me feel confident and comfortable during the session.</p>

          <div class="mt-4">
            <img src="../images/ID_photo.jpeg" class="d-block w-100 object-fit-cover rounded-4" style="height: 504px;" alt="Platter">
          </div>

          <p class="mt-4">After a few quick snaps, the real magic began with a live Photoshop session. It was fascinating to watch the transformation as the photographer skillfully edited the photos, turning what felt like a "ugly duckling" into a polished, perfect image. Once the final edits were done, they sent the digital copies directly to my email. The printed photos were ready immediately, and I was able to take them with me on the spot. The entire process was incredibly efficient, and I was impressed by the high level of service.</p>
          <p>I highly recommend HOLO+FACE for anyone needing passport or visa photos. The professional service, quick turnaround, and quality results made it a wonderful experience. If you're in Taiwan and need official photos, this is the place to go!</p>
