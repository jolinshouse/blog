          <p class="mt-4">Our adventure began in Cebu City, where our first stop was the picturesque Sirao Flower Garden. This stunning garden, also known as the "Little Amsterdam of Cebu," was filled with vibrant flowers and plenty of photo opportunities. The highlight was the iconic hand sculpture, where visitors queued to take the perfect shot. It was a fantastic start to our trip with lots of memorable photos. Next, we visited Temple of Leah and Top of Cebu, both recommended by our driver. These spots are also great for photos, although I found them less impressive compared to the flower garden.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="mt-4">We set off early for Bohol Island via ferry. Our first day on Bohol was filled with land activities. We rented motorcycles to visit the Tarsier Sanctuary and see the adorable, fist-sized tarsiers. Most of them were sleeping when we visited, but it was still a delightful experience.</p>
          <p>We then headed to the Chocolate Hills, one of the worldâ€™s seven natural wonders. The hills looked like green chocolate mounds, especially enchanting during sunset. The view was absolutely breathtaking and felt like something out of a fairy tale.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="mt-4">Our third day started early with water activities. By 5:30 AM, we were ready to swim with whale sharks. Equipped with snorkeling gear, we set off in a small boat and were thrilled to see two massive whale sharks up close. It was a majestic and awe-inspiring experience.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="mt-4">Later, we marveled at the Sardine Run, witnessing thousands of sardines moving in unison. In the afternoon, we visited South Farm, where for just around NT$200, we enjoyed feeding guinea pigs, rabbits, fish, goats, and chickens, and even had a chance to ride a horse. The animals were lively and interactive, making it a highly enjoyable visit. We ended the day at Alona Beach, soaking in the beautiful sunset and relaxing atmosphere. It was the perfect way to unwind after a busy day.</p>

          <p class="mt-4">Another early start took us island hopping. We boarded a bangka (outrigger boat) and set off to spot dolphins. It was my first time seeing so many dolphins, and it was an incredible sight! Our next stop was Balicasag Island for snorkeling. The vibrant tropical fish and stunning coral reefs were mesmerizing. Our boatman even helped us capture amazing photos with a GoPro. Finally, we visited Virgin Island, renowned for its pristine white sand and crystal-clear waters. The serene beauty of the island made it a perfect end to our water activities.</p>

          <p class="mt-4">On our last day, we enjoyed a leisurely breakfast at our hotel before preparing to return to Taiwan. Reflecting on our trip, it was an unforgettable family vacation filled with adventure, beautiful sights, and cherished memories.</p>
